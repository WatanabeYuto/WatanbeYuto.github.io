I am a master's student at Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, under the supervision of Professor Kazunori Sakurama and Toshiyuki Ohtsuka. I received a B.E in Mechanical Engineering in 2022 from Kyoto University, Kyotom Japan. My research interests lie at the intersection of optimization, control theory and networked systems.
